Refine & Customize: Tweak the design, animations, and layouts via prompts or visual edits.
Master Prompting: Use "chat mode" to plan out your project without making edits. Use clear, detailed, and iterative prompts for best results.
GitHub Sync: Transfer your project's code to GitHub for two-way sync of edits.
Since you need to fetch music from external APIs such as YouTube Music and Spotify, you'll need backend functionality. Supabase is a simple way to add these features without complex technical setup.

Fix music app functionality and add auth
Preview Latest

I've fixed the immediate runtime errors and added working search functionality to your music app. Here's what I've implemented:

Fixed the formatTime function error - Added proper error handling and fallback in PlayerControls
Working search functionality - Added SearchResults component and useSearch hook with mock API simulation
Enhanced header with interactive search - Search input with loading states and clear functionality
Improved error handling - Better image loading fallbacks and audio error management
Mobile-responsive design - All components are touch-friendly and work on mobile devices
The app now has a functional search that displays results and allows users to select and play tracks. For the authentication system and real API integration (Spotify, iTunes, etc.), you'll need to connect to Supabase first for secure backend functionality.
